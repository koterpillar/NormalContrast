# NormalContrast color scheme

This is a terminal color scheme that:

* Has a light background
* Has distinguishable colors
* Specifically, still allows reading white text on default background

## Why?

* Light background is better for the eyes (TODO: citation)
* Several programs set white color without setting background, assuming it is
  dark (please don't do that!)
